# Objective_C_drivers_STM32
These projects demonstrate use of objective programming paradigms like:
Encapsulation using structures
Abstraction using declarations
private and public access specifier using .h and .c files
Methods tagging using attribute handles
Polymorphism 

In embedded C programming.
These projects are for GPIO, UART & Systick peripherals on STM32F446RE nucleo.
